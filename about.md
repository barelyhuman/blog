Hi, I'm Pine. I work on Visual Studio Code at Microsoft.

Software engineer is my title, but I aim to become an Information Architect. In the literary level, I work to organize and present information at the right place & time. In a figurative sense, I try to approach programming with empathy and ethics, despite programming itself being a very technical endeavor.

I'm also part of the Vue.js team and I build [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur), a Language Server that enhances the Vue editing experience.

Some projects that I work on:

- [Polacode](https://github.com/octref/polacode): Polaroid for your code.
- [Shiki](http://npmjs.com/package/shiki): A better source code highlighter.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/octref) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/octref).

Say hi to me at [octref@gmail.com](mailto:octref@gmail.com).
